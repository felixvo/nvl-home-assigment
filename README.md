## Goals

1. Addressing concurrency issues when transferring money between accounts (please check TransferServiceTest for test scenarios)
2. Addressing the issue of withdrawal requests that are not immediately processed using a background job

## Data model

```

## Build & Run

```
mvn clean install
java -jar target/nvlproject-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```



## APIs

#### Get all balances (for demonstration purposes)

```
curl -s  ocalhost:8080/balances | jq
{
"1": 1000000,
"2": 0,
"3": 0,
"4": 0,
"5": 0
}
```

### Transfer from one account to another
#### Transfer success
```
curl -s -XPOST localhost:8080/transfer -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"fromAccountId": 1, "toAccountId": 2, "amount": 10}' | jq
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "id": 1,
    "accountId": 1,
    "amount": 10,
    "details": "transfer to account 2",
    "type": "TRANSER"
  }
}
```

#### Transfer fail
```
curl -s -XPOST localhost:8080/transfer -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"fromAccountId": 1, "toAccountId": 2, "amount": 100000000 }' | jq
{
  "status": "failed",
  "error": 1
}
```

### Create a withdrawal request

```
curl -s -XPOST localhost:8080/withdraw -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"fromAccountId": 1, "address": "abcd", "amount": 10}' | jq
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "withdrawalId": "ccfeb15a-e5da-43f8-ab94-6f5dc2dc9b50"
  }
}

```

### Get withdrawal request status

```
curl -s -XGET localhost:8080/withdraw/ccfeb15a-e5da-43f8-ab94-6f5dc2dc9b50 | jq
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "id": 1,
    "fromAccountId": 1,
    "withdrawalId": "ccfeb15a-e5da-43f8-ab94-6f5dc2dc9b50",
    "toAddress": "abcd",
    "amount": 10,
    "status": "SUCCESS"
  }
}
```
